# CSV Cleaner Project

This project contains a Python script that cleans CSV files by removing rows that are not completely filled. It also includes a unit test to ensure the script works correctly.

## Files in the Project

- `clean_csv.py`: This script reads a CSV file and removes any rows that have empty fields.
- `test_clean_csv.py`: This file contains tests to check if the `clean_csv.py` script is functioning as expected.

## How to Run the Script

To clean a CSV file, make sure you have Python installed on your computer and then run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python3 /path/to/clean_csv.py
